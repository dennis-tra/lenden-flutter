# lenden

A new Flutter project.


## Setup
While it's not the end of the world the `GoogleService-Info.plist` is not checked in.
As a note for myself, the AppStore `plist` can be downloaded [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/lenden-1cf29/settings/general/ios:eu.dtrautwein.lenden).
